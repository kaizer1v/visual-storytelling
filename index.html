        It seems that India is quite fanatic about cricket - and yes some are becoming, football fans.

        <div class="title">Let us look at Sports</div>
          Cricket has predominently dominated during te 2013. Was it because of the ICC T20I Championship??
          Maybe.

          If you look at 2013 - India inaugrated the Indian Super Lague and it slowly gained popularity in 3 years
          and at the same time, there were many fans who moved from cricket to football as well.

          Maybe lately, people today (2016) are going back to counter-strike and AOE?

        <div class="title">Study vs Cricket</div>
        Between 19th Feb and 2nd April of 2011, exactly during the board exams, there were parents who left cricket aside and
        concentrated on their children's exams as well. Although, there were enough people who didn't bother about the boards it seems.

        Right after that, India's matches were scheduled in Jan and November, so as not to hamper the examination boards. <a href="http://www.cricbuzz.com/cricket-scorecard-archives/2013" target="_blank">Read more...</a>

          <p>International festivals like christmas, thanksgiving and festive wishes being regularly searched during festive seasons.</p>
          <p>It is also quite sad to see that creativity lacks in India and hopefully one might see the rise over the next decade.</p>
