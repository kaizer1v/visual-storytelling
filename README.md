# Visual Storytelling

This is an attempt to tell a story using google trends data in the style of [Jim Vallandingham](http://vallandingham.me/scroll_demo/)'s scroller.

The insights driven are from the ipython notebook present in the repository. Although, the quality of the insights aren't that high, this simply
is an attempt to test out how effect one can be in telling a good story, given one knows what she/he wants to present.

I'll be putting more of these in the coming times. :)
